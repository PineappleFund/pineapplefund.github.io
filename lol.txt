[11:17:36] <SCAMMER> Hi Admin 
[11:18:16] <@Admin> SCAMMER: what's up?
[11:18:34] <SCAMMER> I need my account unlocked please
[11:18:48] <@Admin> What happened?
[11:19:12] <SCAMMER> I made a stupid mistake and I'm asking for a second chance
[11:19:17] <@Admin> What did you do?
[11:20:13] <SCAMMER> I was trying to scam a rich guy for a couple bitcoin with the intention to donate those to [site]
[11:20:39] <SCAMMER> But I had no idea that you ARE the rich guy I was trying to scam
[11:20:47] <@Admin> I am not rich at all
[11:22:33] <SCAMMER> you are man, there is no other explanation for this. Do not fool with me please
[11:22:58] <@Admin> I'm not fooling with ya but you're talking shit
[11:23:45] <SCAMMER> I tried to scam pineapplefund.org through reddit,
[11:25:00] <SCAMMER> I sent the guy a couple fake screenshots of a forum
[11:25:16] <SCAMMER> I told him there were people talking about pineapplefund and a successful scam
[11:25:43] <SCAMMER> I used [site]'s forum layout as a photoshop base but I did not leak any information of [site]
[11:25:48] <SCAMMER> only used the layout
[11:26:47] <SCAMMER> next, the reply on reddit was like : we checked the logs on [site] and I know who you are, fuck you
[11:27:13] <@Admin> So you admit being a scammer?
[11:27:33] <SCAMMER> only for the greater good. I wanted to send a big donation to [site]!!
[11:28:12] <@Admin> Okay, so you think it's a good idea to send stolen coins to [site]?
[11:28:40] <SCAMMER> yeah, to cover for server costs!!
[11:28:46] <SCAMMER> why else is [site] always asking for donations?
[11:29:02] <@Admin> True but do you think it is a good idea to send STOLEN coins to [site]?
[11:29:17] <SCAMMER> why not?
[11:29:26] <@Admin> I don't know. I'm asking you.
[11:29:42] <SCAMMER> I say yes!
[11:30:57] <@Admin> NO No nonoonono
[11:31:06] <SCAMMER> what?
[11:31:17] <@Admin> I just said NO No nonoonono
[11:31:55] <SCAMMER> Ok
[11:32:16] <SCAMMER> I thought it was a great idea
[11:32:19] <SCAMMER> but I will never do this again
[11:32:40] <SCAMMER> Can you reanble my account?
[11:32:45] <@Admin> I can
[11:32:48] <@Admin> But I won't
[11:32:52] <SCAMMER> why not?
[11:33:08] <@Admin> why would I?
[11:33:55] <SCAMMER> Because I'll be a good now,
[11:34:36] <SCAMMER> and I will send a $150 donation in exchange for all the troubles I have caused so far
[11:34:42] <SCAMMER> I really need access to [site]
[11:35:30] <@Admin> $150 sounds interesting
[11:35:46] <SCAMMER> do we have a deal?
[11:36:00] <@Admin> AnotherAdmin: what do you think?
[11:37:36] <@AnotherAdmin> He didn't do much harm. So I would say: enable his account and accept $150. We need donations to survive
[11:37:44] <SCAMMER> thanks guys
[11:37:47] <SCAMMER> how do we do this?
[11:38:45] <@Admin> I have enabled your account
